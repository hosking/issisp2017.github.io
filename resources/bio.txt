Ronan Lashermes is a postdoctoral researcher at INRIA Rennes, in the LHS lab. Engineer from Grenoble-INP Phelma, after finishing a Ph.D. with the CEA and the UVSQ in 2014, he worked in a startup to develop physical attack benches for devices evaluation. He later joined INRIA and the LHS lab for a postdoc on fault attacks.
He is interested in the security of embedded systems and hardware components and how the abstraction barriers (mathematics/software, hardware/software) can be exploited to compromise a device.
