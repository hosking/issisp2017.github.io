        There is an increasing need for Software Security and Protection due to
        the growing sensitivity of user data coupled with the ubiquitous nature
        of computing systems ranging from tiny embedded devices to powerful data
        centers.
      </p>

      <p>
        The International Summer School on Information Security and Protection
        (ISSISP) highlights this need by bringing internationally renowned
        speakers from diverse fields in Computer Science such as Software
        Engineering, Formal Methods, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems
        and Compiler design into Software Security and Protection.
      </p>

      <p>
        ISSISP is historically centered on MATE (Man-At-The-End) attack
        scenarios, with a strong focus on obfuscation and reverse.
        The 2017 edition will additionally cover control-flow hijacking issues
        as well as software protections against hardware attacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Topics to be covered range from code obfuscation,
        software watermarking, tamper-proofing to
        software protection, formal methods, malware analysis and hardware-based
        attacks.
        ISSISP's courses will include both lectures and hands-on sessions.
