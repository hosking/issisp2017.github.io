    I'm an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the
    University of Arizona. Prior to arriving in Tucson I worked at the University
    of Auckland, New Zealand, and before that I got my Ph.D. from Lund University,
    Sweden. I have also held a visiting position at the Chinese Academy of
    Sciences in Beijing, China. My main research interest is computer security, in
    particular the so-called Man-At-The-End Attack which occurs in settings where
    an adversary has physical access to a device and compromises it by tampering
    with its hardware or software. My current research focuses on remote
    man-at-the-end attacks which occur in distributed systems where untrusted
    clients are in frequent communication with trusted servers over a network, and
    a malicious user can get an advantage by compromising an untrusted device.

    I am a full time Professor in the department of Computer Science at the
    University of Verona, Italy. I earned my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from
    the University of Pisa in 1993.
    My research interests are abstract interpretation, static program analysis,
    semantics of programming languages, program verification, abstract
    model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset
    protection, code obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory. In
    lattice theory, I contributed to understanding of the structure of the lattice
    of closure operators and complete congruence relations on complete lattices.
