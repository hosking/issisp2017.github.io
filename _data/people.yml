    Christian Collberg is a Professor at the Department of Computer Science at
    the University of Arizona. He got his PhD from Lund University, Sweden and 
    taught at University of Auckland, New Zealand, before joining Arizona. His
    current research interests lie in the protection of software from reverse
    engineering and tampering, as well as in the reproducibility of computer
    science research (see FindResearch.org). He is the author of "Surreptitious
    Software, Obfuscation, Watermarking, and Tamperproofing for Software Protection".

  abstract: >-
    We will look at traditional ways of obfuscating code, i.e. ways to make
    software harder to understand and analyze. There will be a significant
    hands-on practical component to this part of the course, where we will
    obfuscate code using automatic tools.

    Roberto Giacobazzi was born in 1964 in Modena, Italy. He received the Laurea
    degree in Computer Science in 1988 from the University
    of Pisa, and in 1993 he received the Ph.D. in Computer Science from the same university. From 1993 to 1995 he had a Post Doctoral
    Research position at Laboratoire d'Informatique (LIX), Ecole Polytechnique (Paris) in the equipe Cousot. From 1995 to 1998 he was
    (tenured) Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Pisa. From 1998 to 2000 he was Associate Professor at the
    University of Verona. From May 2000 until now he is Full Professor in Computer Science at the University of Verona.
    The research interests of Roberto Giacobazzi include abstract interpretation, static program analysis, semantics of programming
    languages, program verification, abstract model-checking, program transformation and optimization, digital asset protection, code
    obfuscation, software watermarking and lattice theory.

  abstract: >-
    In this course I will introduce the basics of code obfuscation starting from
    its formal definition towards the impossibility result
    on universal Virtual-Black Box obfuscation of a generic Turing Machine. We
    then see how to weaken this result in order to have
    possibility results for restricted models of attack to SW systems as
    specified as automatic program analysis tools and algorithms.
    We will see through some examples how obfuscation can become possible
    against an attacker specified as an interpreter and how
    virtualisation provides the best strategy to protect your code against automated program analysis.

    was acquired by Irdeto. Since then, as a chief architect and a senior research
    director of Irdeto, Mr. Gu is also leading the development of next generation
    Cloakware technology, and research
    collaboration with research communities worldwide. Mr. Gu has been invited
    and visited over 40 universities and research institutes in North American,
    Europe and Asia, and organizing international security forums (workshops,
    summer schools, and association) and
    becomes an active speaker at many international conferences and workshops to
    promote software security and protection. Mr. Gu was invited being a guest
    professor of Northwest University in China. As a native Chinese, Mr. Gu often
    represents Irdeto to involve many
    business development and research collaboration activities in China.

    Prior to joining Cloakware, Mr. Gu has worked as a senior scientist and
    architect at Nortel Networks. Previously, Mr. Gu was a visiting professor at
    the Computer Science School of McGill University at Montreal of Canada between
    1988-1990. Before relocated to Canada,  Mr. Gu was a professor in the
    Computer Science Department at Northwest University in China. Mr. Gu
    received the First Outstanding Young Scientists Foundation Award from the

    No matter for business use or personal use, un-trusted environments have
    more dominated in digital world from consumer devices to home networks, to
    the public Internet, to the cloud and web services, and to the Internet of
    Things, where traditional security
    models are inadequate to address emerging threat models and attacks. The
    wireless connectivity quickly gains in popularity in recent years and
    provides anything/anytime/anywhere connection to playing contents, e-mail,
    instant messaging, online gaming and shopping,
    mobile banking, mobile payment, weather and travel information, connected
    and autonomous vehicles and much more of other digital services. All of
    these makes white-box security and digital asset protection much more
    challenging. This course describes and discusses
    white-box software attack scenarios and security patterns (that are abstracted
    from many application domains in terms of use cases, v ulnerability and
    threat analysis, and security solutions), the security lifecycle of digital
    asset application mandating protection
    from creation, through distribution and then ultimately consumption from
    being deployed in the field. Also, we introduce homomorphic obfuscation
    technology and detail certain currently software protection technologies in
    markets as a guide to the state of the art including.

    This course is structured in two sessions: 1) a course lecture; 2) a panel
    to host a group of industrial experts to present, discuss and explore some
    most interesting software and information protection issues in emerging
    markets.

     I am Professor of Computer Science at the University of Virginia. I
     received my Ph.D. from the University of Arizona in 1981 and
     joined the University of Virginia in 1982. Over the years, I have worked in
     many areas including compilers, embedded systems, high-performance
     computing, and computer security. My current research foci is on software
     protection and computer security. In the
     area of software security, my group has developed dynamic methods to
     prevent adversaries from compromising intellectual property.
     In the area of computer security, we have developed methods for "hardening"
     binaries to make them impervious to cyber attack. In
     2014–2016, I lead a team at the University of Virginia that competed in the
     DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC)—a contest to build an
     autonomous supercomputer to automatically analyze vulnerable binaries and
     patch them—all without human intervention. Our entry, produced in
     collaboration with Grammatech, Inc., finished second winning a $1M prize.  I
     am also leading a DARPA project, "Double Helix: High Assurance N-variant
     Systems." Double Helix is a binary analysis and transformation system that
     processes binary
     applications and produces variants with diverse binary structures that are
     intended to be deployed within a multi-variant system. A
     unique aspect of Double Helix is that it employs structured diversity to
     guarantee that variants behave differently yielding
     high-assurance systems.  Both CGC and Double Helix rely on high-precision
     binary analysis and rewriting to reverse engineer and
     transform binaries.

    In this course we will focus on side channel attacks.  We will first
    show how and why these attacks are powerful and effective, especially
    against embedded devices.  We will present the main principles of
    countermeasures currently used in secured systems, and discuss the
    metrics for measuring the effectiveness of such countermeasures.  As
    time permits, we will discuss at the end of the course solutions to
    automate the applications of such countermeasures at the software level.

    He is interested in the security of embedded systems and hardware components
    and how the abstraction barriers (mathematics/software, hardware/software) can
    be exploited to compromise a device.
  abstract: >-
    What happens if your program is not executed as it should, if some instructions are not executed?
    Here comes the world of fault injection attacks, where all your assumptions
    on the adversary's capabilities tumble down.
    Fault attacks have mainly been used to break cryptographic algorithms in the
    past, but we will see how they can also be used in relation with software
    attacks against embedded systems (Phones, IoT, set-top boxes...).
    Of course, what we can do to protect ourselves will be discussed as well as
    the impact of modern technologies (complex SoC, TrustZone, ...).
    Finally, we will try to analyze some pieces of software to spot
    vulnerabilities wrt fault attacks and discuss what can be automated by tools
    and what would be hard to achieve automatically.
